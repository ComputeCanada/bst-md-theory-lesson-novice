# Introduction
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used as tools to investigate structure and dynamics of proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids  under a wide variety of conditions. MD is the simulation of atomic positions in time accomplished by solving classical Newton's equation of motion stating that the rate of change of momentum **p** of an object equals the force **F** acting on it: **F** = d**p**/dt.
