Dynamical molecular systems are characterized by numerous degrees of freedom. The thermal motion of molecules can be decomposed into translational, rotational and vibrational components (degrees of freedom). Each ot these terms contrututes quadratically to the average energy. Classical equipartition principle states that every degree of freedom contributes equally to the total energy in thermal equilibrium. Each degree of freedom has an average energy of  ½kBT  and contributes  ½kB to the system's heat capacity.

## Translational degrees of freedom
An atom or a molecule can move in 3D.

Any atom or molecule has three degrees of freedom associated with translational motion of the center of mass with respect to the X, Y, and Z axes.

- The three translational degrees of freedom in three dimensions provide 3/2kBT of energy.

## Rotational degrees of freedom
A molecule can rotate.

A linear molecule, has two rotational degrees of freedom, because it can rotate about either of two axes perpendicular to the molecular axis. The rotations along the molecular axis has no meaning because such rotations lead to configurations which are indistinguishable from the original configuration.

A nonlinear molecule, where the atoms do not lie along a single axis, like water, has three rotational degrees of freedom, because it can rotate around any of three perpendicular axes.

- The rotational degrees of freedom provide kBT of energy for linear molecules and 3/2kBT of energy for non-linear molecules.

## Vibrational degrees of freedom
A molecule can also vibrate.

A diatomic molecule has one molecular vibration mode, where the two atoms oscillate back and forth with the chemical bond between them acting as a spring.

A molecule with *N* atoms has more complicated modes of molecular vibration, with *3N − 5* vibrational modes for a linear molecule and *3N − 6* modes for a nonlinear molecule.

Each vibrational mode has two degrees of freedom for energy. One degree of freedom involves the kinetic energy of the moving atoms, and one degree of freedom involves the potential energy of the spring-like chemical bond(s).

- Each vibrational degree of freedom provides kBT of energy. This isvalid only when kBT is much bigger than spacing between vibrational states.  At low temperature this condition is not satisfied, only a few vibrational states are occupied and the equipartition principle is not typically applicable.
