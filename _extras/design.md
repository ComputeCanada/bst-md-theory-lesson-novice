## Motivation for the BST-Workshop series

The motivation behind this 3-part workshop/tutorial series is to give new grad 
students an introduction into preparing, running and analyzing MD simulations.
The series is not meant to be a replacement for university courses in thermodynamics 
and statistical thermodynamics.  Instead this series takes an applied approach
and touches on theory only as much it is necessary to aid choosing reasonable
simulation parameters.

The **first lesson** is a hands-on example on how to use GROMACS to prepare and 
submit a MD simulation.  There are numerous good GROMACS tutorials available and 
maybe one of them could be adapted for this.  In addition to general instructions 
and commands, there should be specific instructions on how to do this on Compute 
Canada clusters.  As in Software Carpentry lessons, certain steps should be 
implelemented as exercises for the learner - the correct answer can be hidden in 
an answer box.  
Theory should be skipped over as much as possible and should be covered in the 
second module.  
This lesson could be adapted for other MD-codes (e.g. NAMD) as well.

The **second lesson** is a small theory review to remind the learners of important 
concepts and how they influence the choice of simulation parameters.  The aim is
that people can avoid pit-falls and misunderstandings that are commonly made
by novice MD users. Topics to cover are Periodic Boundary Conditions (and why 
there is no "outside" with a periodic box), thermostats/barostats, cut-offs, etc.  
This shold be no substitute for a formal course in statistical thermodynamics 
but should help users make more informed choices of simulation settings/parameters.

The **third lesson** is again a hands-on tutorial to use Python and the Python 
packages [MDAnalysis](https://www,mdanalysis.org), [MDtraj](http://mdtraj.org/),
and [NGLview](http://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/) to write their own analysis 
tools.  While, for example GROMACS, comes with a very large number of analysis 
tools out-of-the-box, users often limit themselves to those tools and the options
and variations that they offer.  The above frameworks make it very easy to read 
MD-trajectories in different formats and get access to the coordinates and come 
up with fully customized analysis methods.
